# B&B in C++

This projects goal was to create a B&amp;B Reservation system using C++ and basic file Input/Output reading/writing.

When the code is run, it'll open a terminal and read from the input.txts that exist and run various data validation methods all at once and write out if it found any errors in the info given/written. 

The goal of this project was pretty much just me learning about header creation as well as their use in classes, as well as Input/Output via basic txt files. It isn't user friendly really nor was it meant to be.
